# 📘 JavaScript Learning Journey — Day-Wise Roadmap & Practice Guide

Welcome to the **JavaScript Learning Journey Repository** — a clean, structured, and practical way to learn JavaScript step by step.

Each day contains:

* 📝 **notes.md** → theory
* 💻 **practice folders** → hands-on examples (HTML + JS)
* 🔍 **mini demos** → small, focused experiments

This structure helps you learn JavaScript through *both explanation and practice*.


## 🗂️ Repository Structure (Day-Wise)

<div align="center">

| Day    | Topic                                                       | Folder                               |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Day-01 | Introduction to JavaScript, Script Integration, Strict Mode | `Day-01-Introduction-To-JavaScript/` |
| Day-05 | Variable Behavior / Dynamic Typing                          | `Day-05-Variable-Behavior/`          |
| Day-02 | Coming Soon                                                 | `Day-02-...`                         |
| Day-03 | Coming Soon                                                 | `Day-03-...`                         |
| Day-04 | Coming Soon                                                 | `Day-04-...`                         |

## 📁 Folder Layout (Exactly As Your Repo Is Structured)

Each day folder looks like this:

```
Day-XX-Topic-Name/
│
├── notes.md              → Theory notes for the day
│
├── 01-example-folder/    → Practice demo (HTML + JS)
├── 02-example-folder/
├── 03-example-folder/
└── ...
```

This structure ensures:

* **Notes are separate**
* **Each concept has its own demo folder**
* **You can open any HTML file directly in the browser**


## 🧭 How to Use This Repository

Follow this daily routine:


### **1️⃣ Start with `notes.md`**

Read about the day’s topic:

* Concepts
* Syntax
* Examples
* Drawbacks
* Tips


### **2️⃣ Open each practice folder**

Inside every folder:

```
01-inline-js/
    index.html
02-embedded-js/
    index.html
03-external-js/
    index.html + script.js
...
```

Open the HTML files in your browser to see the live output.


### **3️⃣ Edit and experiment**

Try:

* Changing variable values
* Turning strict mode on/off
* Adding more JavaScript
* Breaking the code intentionally
* Printing output to console

This builds strong understanding.


### **4️⃣ Add your own examples**

Every day, create at least **one extra demo**:

Example:

```
07-my-own-test/
    index.html
```

This helps you learn faster.

## 🎯 Why This Structure Works

☑️ Simple \
☑️ Consistent \
☑️ Beginner-friendly  
☑️ Easy to navigate   
☑️ Clear separation of theory vs practice \
☑️ Scales as you learn more concepts

## 🤝 Contribute to Your Own Learning

As you learn:

* Add notes
* Add more practice examples
* Add comments inside your code
* Document your observations

Your repo becomes your personal JavaScript textbook.
